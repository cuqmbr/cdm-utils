### Description

During studying students often have to do routine work while doing hometasks, practical exercises and tests. In order to solve more complex task often you need to perform a few easy but time consuming actions. We have presented the solution to this problem in the form of a web application: a calculator in Discrete Mathematics, which includes Set algebra and Boolean algebra calculators.

This is our small university project. You can check github-pages deployment [here](https://cuqmbr.github.io/cdm-utils/)
